Using artificial intelligence to read coronary angiogram: we trained a type of AI/ Computer vision called convolutional neural networks to read coronary angiogram. The neural networks were put into an Iphone.  Using the Iphone, we demonstrate how to use the iPhone app containing these neural networks to read coronary angiogram in "Live Cases."
